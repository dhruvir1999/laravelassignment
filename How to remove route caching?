To remove route caching in Laravel, you can use the route:clear Artisan command.
This command will clear the route cache file, and Laravel will then recompile the routes the next time they are accessed. 
Follow these steps:

Open your terminal or command prompt.

Run the following Artisan command:

php artisan route:clear
This command will remove the cached routes, and Laravel will regenerate the routes on the next request.

Remember that route caching is typically used in production to optimize the performance of your application by reducing the time it takes to register routes. 
In a development environment, it's often not necessary to use route caching, as Laravel will dynamically reload the routes. 
If you encounter any issues related to routes during development, clearing the route cache can be a useful step.
