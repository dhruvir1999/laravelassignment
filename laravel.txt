How to pass Multiple Variable in route?
-> In Laravel, you can pass multiple variables in a route by defining route parameters in the route definition. Route parameters are enclosed in {} curly braces. Here's an example of how you can pass multiple variables in a route:



use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Route;

Route::get('/user/{user_id}/{username}', 'UserController@show');

// Controller Method
public function show($user_id, $username)
{
    return "User ID: $user_id, Username: $username";
}
